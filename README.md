# Learning Go

The last year or so I've been learning and working a lot with Docker and Kubernetes. I think that
these are amazing technologies with a very bright future and they've helped me and my fellow engineers
a lot with experimenting, creating, delivering and maintaining tools, services, systems and products.

Even though I'm getting more and more proficient with these technologies by using them almost daily,
I don't necessarily always understand _how_ they work internally. I know from experience that we don't
always need to know the nitty-gritty of the tools we use to get our jobs done, but I do believe that
a deeper understanding can contribute to delivering higher quality results. Besided, I'm a curious
person by nature üòÖ.

So when I started digging around, I found out that Docker and Kubernetes are written in Go and Go
kept on popping up more often while becoming more popular. I got curious, did the [tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1),
build some simple things, dug into goroutines, channels, concurrency, all the good stuff, but didn't
document anything or had the opportunity to apply them in practice. The end result? I forgot most of it,
because of all the other interesting stuff I'm learning about; Distributed Systems, (Event Driven)
Microservice Architecture and DevOps to name a few high level subjects.

Therefore I thought it would be nice to refresh my Go knowledge, dig a bit deeper and this time write
down the things I learn. Maybe it'll be usefull to others, but at least I'll have a nice reference for
when I forget things again üòÅ.
